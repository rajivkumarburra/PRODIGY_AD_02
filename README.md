# To-Do App

A To-Do App made using Flutter, Dart and Firebase.

## About

This project is my second submission towards my internship with Prodigy Infotech.

This To-Do app allows users to add tasks and swipe them once they are complete to mark them as complete. The app also allows users to sign in using their email and password and stores their tasks in a Firebase database. The app also allows users to sign out.
